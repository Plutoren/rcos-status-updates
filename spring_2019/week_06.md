## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Made a TON of progress on the Wiki. It really looks like a finished project now.

### Links to Github
In no particular order.

[Link 1](https://github.com/Plutoren/shuttletracker/wiki/Map/_history)

[Link 2](https://github.com/Plutoren/shuttletracker/wiki/_Sidebar/_history)

[Link 3](https://github.com/Plutoren/shuttletracker/wiki/Front-End/_history)

[Link 4](https://github.com/Plutoren/shuttletracker/wiki/Schedules/_history)

[Link 5](https://github.com/Plutoren/shuttletracker/wiki/admin-panel/_history)

[Link 6](https://github.com/Plutoren/shuttletracker/wiki/_history)

> There are so many links because github only shows history for wiki pages by each page.

## This Week's Plan

> Open a pull request

## Anything Blocking?

> I need to move several of the pictures from gyazo to github but the techinique I used previously stopped working (drag image into github issue tracker)
