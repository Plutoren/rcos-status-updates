## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Learned how to install the new version of shuttle tracker, it requires a bunch of extra steps and removes some of the old steps. I also took screenshots of the process so I can add it to the readme.
## This Week's Plan

> Write up the new readme with all the screenshots and such and commit my changes again

## Anything Blocking?

> I had 3 tests last week but this week looks clear so I should get a lot more done

## Notes
